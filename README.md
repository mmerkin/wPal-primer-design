The consensus sequences of the 16S rRNA genes from the 3 major clades and the peripheral branch that is basal to blue. 

Plan:

1) Check for indels (None found)
2) Map SNPs onto reference (consensus sequences produced)
3) Find region with high FST between all 3 clades (16S rRNA chosen)
4) Filter fasta files to only contain these regions (done)

Still to do:

5) Produce a restriction map of the 16S rRNA genes
6) Identify SNPs found within a restriction site that can be used to distinguish the clades
7) Design primers either side of that restriction site to produce fragments of different sizes
8) Check that the primers are suitable for use (eg appropriate melting temp, site specificity)
