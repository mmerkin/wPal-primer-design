# wPal-primer-design

Plan:

1) Check for indels (None found)
2) Map SNPs onto reference (consensus sequences produced)
3) Find SNPs with a FST between all 4 clades
4) Filter fasta files to only contain these regions (done)
5) Produce a restriction map of these regions (no suitable restriction sites found-> Sanger approach instead)
6) Design primers using primer3
